* Ideas

	There are many pending classes that need to be implemented.  Those have
	the highest impact in the Mono project: the sooner they are done,
	the sooner we can start using this platform to create new and
	exciting applications.

	That being said, if you are not very excited about working on class
	libraries, here is a list of other related projects or tools that might
	be useful to the Mono project.

	Here are a few ideas of tools, classes and projects that you
	could start. More are forthcoming.

** Classes

	<ul>
		* Implement a JXTA protocol implementation:
		<a href="http://www.jxta.org">http://www.jxta.org</a>

		* Implement a Mail API, similar to Camel or JavaMail (Camel has
		  significant architecture features that are required on a real
		  mailer).

		  You can check the current C 
		<a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/bonsai/rview.cgi?dir=evolution%2Fcamel">
		Camel implementation</a>.

		  Such an implementation could be used both with
		  Microsoft .NET and Mono.

		* Interfacing to Multimedia systems.  You might want
		  to look into the Quicktime API.  I know <a

		  researched the problem before

** Projects

	This list of projects ideas is outdated

		* Once <a href="http://remoting-corba.sourceforge.net/">CORBA</a> is done, implement the Bonobo interfaces
		  to allow people to use Bonobo components in Mono and
		  Mono components with Bonobo.  The best of both worlds!

		* A naming space for Mono.  An object naming space is
		  a very powerful tool.  Bonobo implements a moniker
		  system that is more powerful than the original
		  moniker concept that was pioneered by COM/OLE in the
		  Microsoft world.

		  Our implementation builds on a concept, and we have
		  made it simpler, more powerful, more extensible and
		  a much better mechanism than the equivalent monikers
		  on Windows. 

		  Implementing Mono monikers would benefit both
		  Windows users using .NET and Mono users on Unix and
		  Windows.  

		  Here is <a
		  href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/monikers.html">an
		  overview of the moniker system</a> in Bonobo.
