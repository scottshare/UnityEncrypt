* Debugging information

	Compile your programs using the `-g' flag in MCS, that will all a special
	resource containing debugging information to your executable.

	To get stack traces with line number information, you need to run your 
	program like this:

	<b>
	mono --debug program.exe
	</b>

	Notice that the program will need to be compiled with the -g
	flag and that running with --debug will slow down the execution.

* Debugging with GDB

	If you use GDB to debug your mono process, you can use the function
	mono_print_method_from_ip(void *address) to obtain the name of a method
	given an address.

	For example:

	<pre>
(gdb) where
#0  ves_icall_System_String_GetHashCode (me=0x80795d0) at string-icalls.c:861
#1  0x0817f490 in ?? ()
#2  0x0817f42a in ?? ()
#3  0x0817f266 in ?? ()
#4  0x0817f1a5 in ?? ()
</pre>

	You can now use:

<pre>
(gdb) p mono_print_method_from_ip (0x0817f490)
IP 0x817f490 at offset 0x28 of method (wrapper managed-to-native) System.String:GetHashCode () (0x817f468 0x817f4a4)
$1 = void
(gdb) p mono_print_method_from_ip (0x0817f42a)
IP 0x817f42a at offset 0x52 of method System.Collections.Hashtable:GetHash (object) (0x817f3d8 0x817f43b)
$2 = void
</pre>

	Mono support libraries use a couple of signals internally that
	confuse gdb, you might want to add this to your .gdbinit file:

<pre>
	handle SIGPWR nostop noprint 
	handle SIGXCPU nostop noprint 
</pre>

* Mono Debugger 

	The Mono debugger is written in C# and can debug both managed
	and unmanaged applications, support for multiple-threaded
	applications and should be relatively easy to port to new
	platforms.

	Details of the release are available in <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-January/011415.html">post</a>. 
	
	The debugger contains both Gtk# and command line interfaces.
	The debugging file format used in Dwarf (it's already supported
	by our class libraries and the Mono C# compiler; To debug C
	applications, you need a recent GCC, or to pass the -gdwarf-2
	flag to gcc).

	You can download the releases from <a

	home page.</a>
