* Anonymous CVS access

	Anonymous access to the Mono is available currently from three
	servers (anoncvs-spain-1.go-mono.com,
	anoncvs-spain-2.go-mono.com and us-anoncvs.go-mono.com).

	You can also use `anoncvs.go-mono.com', and that will pick a
	server automatically for you.

	Sources are currently being updated every hour.

** Checking out the sources

	To check out the sources for the first time from the
	repository, use this command:

<pre>
	export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com:/mono
	cvs login
	cvs -z3 co mcs mono gtk-sharp
</pre>

	That will get you the compiler and class libraries (mcs), the
	interpreter and JITer (mono) and the Gtk# bindings.

	The server is located in Spain.

** Updating the sources

	To update your sources every day, you use this command:

<pre>
	export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com:/mono
	cvs -z3 update -dP mcs mono gtk-sharp
</pre>

** Thanks

	Thanks to <a href="http://www.hispalinux.es">HispaLinux</a>
	for providing this Anon CVS server.  The server is located in
	Spain.

	Special thanks to Jesus Climent, Rodrigo Moya, Juantomás
	García and Ismael Olea for making this happen.

	Thanks to Matt Liotta of MontaraSoftware for hosting our
	US-based AnonCVS server.

** Becoming an AnonCVS mirror

	To become an AnonCVS mirror, you currently need about 40
	megabytes of free disk space and bandwidth that you do not
	mind sharing (you probably want enough to spare).

	I need to be able to rsync to your machine from the main CVS
	server.  The preferred method to rsync is to setup ssh in your
	machine.

	The requirements are:
	<ul>
		* An account where we can ssh into.

		* rsync.

		* AnonCVS setup with the same paths as the rest of the
		  servers.

		* Currently, about 40 megabytes of disk space, but this 
		  will likely grow as the project evolves.

		* A sysadmin contact e-mail address.
	</ul>
