* Project Status


	Pieces of Mono that have been implemented:

	<ul>
		* C# compiler: The C# compiler is mostly complete, a 
	 	few features are still missing (for a list, check the
		<a href="c-sharp.html">C# compiler</a> web page.

		* The Mono JIT engine (<b>mono</b>.  The JIT engine is
	        the real
		virtual machine that we support.  It is
		currently functional, and we are improving its speed,
		and making it feature complete.

		* A CIL bytecode interpreter (<b>mint</b>).  This
		currently can be used to run most .NET programs
		(modulo the fact that our class libraries are not
		complete enough).

		<b>mint</b> can currently run the Mono C# compiler and
		the compiler generates valid code.  

		We use <b>mint</b> as a reference implementation of
		the runtime environment and to quickly support
		non-Intel platforms.

		* Metadata library: Can currently parse
		and load information from .NET modules (executables
		and DLL files).

		* Disassembler: Can disassemble .NET modules. Still
		lacking exception handling as well as useful debugging
		tools (hex dumping, token dumping).

		* Class Libraries: You can check the current status in the
		  <a href="class-status.html">Class Status page</a>.
	</ul>
