** Microsoft and GNU and Linux.

Q: Does this mean that Microsoft is better than Linux?

A: Many of us are working on <a
   href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software<a>
   and want to have an <a href="http://www.opensource.org">open
   source</a> environment that we can change, modify, improve, learn
   from, and share with others.  Some of us also think that this will
   lead on the long run to better software: more efficient, faster,
   more robust and more.  

   We are willing to take good ideas from any source they come from.
