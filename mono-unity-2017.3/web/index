@item May 10th, 2004: The Mono Hackers Hall of Fame welcomes Todd Berman

	continues to show our appreciation to the excellent
	contributors that make <b>mono::</b> a successful free
	software project.

	Todd Berman is a steady contributor to Mono.  He has worked
	everywhere: from the Class Libraries, to the early implementation of
	the GAC and most recently has lead the effort to develop, port and
	maintain MonoDevelop an IDE for the Mono environment.  His help has
	been key to the development of Mono.

@item May 2nd, 2004: mDnsResponder.Net;  Global Assembly Cache.

	Brady Anderson has released the first version of his <a href=
	"http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?mdnsresponder">multicast
	DNS responder</a> written in C# for the Mono and .NET
	platforms.  This is the foundation for implementing
	rendezvous-like functionality in your applications.

	The tree has started to stabilize after all the changes last
	week to integrate the Global Assembly Cache work that Jackson,
	Sebastien, Todd and all the volunteers helped us deploy.

@item Apr 22nd, 2004: XSP 0.12 released.

	A new release of XSP is available. It fixes a bug that made Web Services
	unusable from client proxies. You can download it from <a
	href="/archive/xsp-0.12.tar.gz">here</a>.
	
@item Apr 21st, 2004: XSP 0.11 and mod_mono 0.8 released.

	Gonzalo has made new releases of XSP and mod_mono (The ASP.NET
	hosting service for Mono).

	Check the XSP/mod_mono <a href="archive/xsp-0.10.html">
	Release Notes</a> to see what is new and to obtain the source
	packages.

@item Apr 20, 2004: S390 port; Interpreted Updated;  Identity classes;  System.Drawing; Mono Debugger.

	Neale who originally wrote the S390 interpreter support for
	Mono has checked into CVS his port of the S390 JIT engine.
	Now, if we could only have one of those in our living room.

	Bernie has checked into CVS a new interpreter for the Mono
	runtime.  This new interpreter translates the CIL opcodes into
	a new intermediate representation.  The new IL representation
	avoids doing costly lookups during interpretation which means that the
	interpreter is a lot faster now.

	Performance wise, the new interpreter is three times faster
	than the old one when doing a compiler bootstrap.

	Sebastien has recently completed the identity classes in the
	Mono Runtime, you can see more details on his <a
	href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/poupou.html">blog</a>

	New progress on the GDI+ front: Jordi has completed the region
	code; Ravindra the various brushes that we must support;
	Sanjay the Icon and BMP loaders (with Mark) and Vladimir has
	contributed various codecs and a new fresh implementation of
	Image.LockBits.

	Lluis and Atsushi in the meantime has been in charge of
	completing various pending items from our class libraries:
	basically an API audit of the things missing for the Mono 1.0
	release, small but important things.

	Martin has replaced the old command-line language in the
	debugger with our home-grown "Command Line" language, a
	TCL-like command line language that we built for it (its a
	tiny .NETized Tcl-like language).  The interaction process is
	a lot smoother than it used to be and we are focusing on the
	usability of the command line language to improve the
	debugging experience.

@item Apr 02, 2004: Mono C# Compiler gets CLS support;   Basic Runtime Contribution from Mainsoft.

	Marek Safar has been working for a few months on adding
	support to the C# compiler to support the various checks required
	by the Common Language Specification (CLS).

	In the past the C# compiler was unable to flag any problems
	related to the creation of cross-language libraries.  Today
	with this patch the compiler will properly flag errors in CLS
	compliance.  Tests for all of the errors have also been
	included on CVS.

	<a href="http://www.mainsoft.com">Mainsoft</a> has contributed
	an implementation of their Basic runtime to the project.  The
	runtime they wrote is written in Java and we are translating
	this into C# code.  The code will reach CVS within the next
	few weeks.

	Mainsoft also contributed an extensive regression test suite
	for the Basic runtime, a port of the NIST XML tests and their
	own in-house developed XML tests. 

@item Mar 31st, 2004: Gtk# 0.18, MonoDoc 0.13, MonoDevelop 0.2 released

	New versions of Gtk# and MonoDoc have been released.

	Gtk# is available from <a
	href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk# home page</a> and MonoDoc 0.13
	is available from our <a href="download.html">download</a>
	page.

	Gtk# now features [ConnectBefore] attribute for hooking up
	signals; An automake/autoconf setup; the System.Drawing
	dependency has been dropped and many more docs.

	And <a href="http://www.monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop 0.2</a>
	has been released.

@item Mar 18th, 2004: Mono 0.31 has been released

	We have released version 0.31 of Mono.  All the new features
	and improvements are described in our <a
	href="archive/mono-0.31.html">Mono 0.31 Release Notes</a>. 

	You can download Mono 0.31 packages using Red Carpet, or pick
	the individual packages from our <a
	href="download.html">download</a> page.

@item Mar 15th, 2004: Async IO lands on Mono.

	Gonzalo has completed the implementation of Async I/O for Mono
	using the kernel aio_* interfaces.  If your operating system supports
	the aio_ POSIX interface, the FileStream methods that
	expose asynchronous methods will use this facility instead of
	emulating it with threads as we have done in the past.

	We had this request come to us from various people in the
	past, and we are now looking for your help to test and debug
	this.

@item Mar 11th, 2004: Mono JIT ported to SPARC.

	Zoltan Varga announced today that the SPARC port of the Mono
	JIT engine has been completed.  Congratulations to Zoltan for
	this amazing development.
