* History of remapping

	The Mono runtime was shipped with the .NET 1.1 library APIs,
	but until recently we did not have strong names or Global
	Assembly Cache support so our libraries did not actually
	encode the proper information about references.

	Lacking this, in the early days of Mono we hardcoded our code
	generator to set the values to the version of the .NET 1.0 API
	to allow code to move back and forth between Windows and Linux.

	With the deployment of the GAC to Mono we no longer distribute
	assemblies without version information, and they are only
	available through a versioned directory.

	To assist people in migrating their applications from the
	pre-Beta rollout of Mono, the runtime has a special feature to
	remap references to the System.* assemblies with version 3300
	to version 5000 but a warning is displayed:

	<pre>
	Compat mode: the request from XXXX to load YYYY was remapped (http://www.go-mono.com/remap.html)
	</pre>

	To solve this issue, use a new version of Mono to rebuild the
	program listed as XXXX, this will remove the warning.

	Alternatively, if you do not have the source, you can set the
	environment variable MONO_SILENT_WARNING to eliminate those
	messages:

	<pre>
	export MONO_SILENT_WARNING=1
	</pre>
