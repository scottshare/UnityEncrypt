################ Requirements

You must have complete and working "mono" and "mcs" checkouts from
CVS. You will probably need to bootstrap your Mono installation,
although an existing install from RPMs may permit you to build the CVS
versions more easily.

############## Samples 


  If you want to add a new item in the left menu 
  you have to edit mono/doc/web/commands and add
  the entry there.

    For new files you can add something as:
    level,entry,path_to_the_file,file.src

    ex: 1,COBOL#,cobol.html,cobol.src

    If you just want to add a link to the menu:
    1,MyEntry,URL
    
    ex: 1,About Linux,http://www.linux.org

  To test the results under Linux:
    1. Edit mono/doc/web/makefile

    Delete all the references to class status
    and the deploy/index.rss as well as the
    mono.exe commands.

    2. make
    3. Open your browser and point to the 
       file:///(YOUR PATH HERE)mono/doc/web/deploy/index.html
