* ASP.NET

	ASP.NET support is divided in two pieces:
	<ul>
		* Web Forms (Web Applications infrastructure).

		* Web Services (the SOAP-based rpc system).
	</ul>

	Both are fully functional at this point.
	
	Publicly available applications such as <a
	href="http://www.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=5&tabid=42">
	IBuySpy</a>, <a href="http://www.ngallery.org/">nGallery</a> and
	many others are known to work.

	Web Services stack is being used for commercial applications
	such as <a
	href="http://www.ximian.com/about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=sourcegear">
	SourceGear</a>'s <a
	href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/index.asp">Vault</a>. They
	even funded the development of our Web Services classes back in
	2002. Another example is OpenLink's
	<a href="http://www.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/">Virtuoso</a>. People
	from OpenLink also contributed to Mono.
	

* Hosting ASP.NET

	Using ASP.NET System.Web.Hosting namespace classes you can make
	your own ASP.NET enabled server.

	However, if you want to take the easy path, we provide two
	different mechanisms for hosting ASP.NET applications:
	<ul>
		* <a href="#xsp">XSP</a>: A light-weight web server
		written in C#.

		* <a href="#mod_mono">mod_mono</a>: An <a
		href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a> module that
		works with both 1.3 and 2.0 versions.
	</ul>

<a name="xsp">
** XSP

	XSP is a simple web server written in C# that can be used to
	run your ASP.NET applications.  The code is available from our
	<a href="download.html">download page</a> or from the <a
	href="anoncvs.html">Anonymous CVS</a> repository (module name:
	xsp).
	
	A couple of classes of this new server can be reused/extended
	to make an apache module/cgi using mono (MonoWorkerRequest and
	MonoApplicationHost).  This server also uses a couple of
	plugins distributed with Mono to support gzip HTTP transfers.

	There is also a set of pages, controls and web services that you
	can use to test the server and see how ASP.NET looks like.

	As XSP is written in C# and uses System.Web classes to perform
	its job, it also works under MS runtime.
	
<a name="mod_mono">
** mod_mono

	This Apache module is available from our <a
	href="download.html">download page</a>. The <a href="anoncvs.html">
	cvs</a> module name is mod_mono.

	It allows apache to serve ASP.NET pages by proxying the requests
	to a slightly modified version of our XSP called mod-mono-server
	that is installed along with XSP.

	It does not work on Windows.
