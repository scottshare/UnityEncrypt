** System.Windows.Forms

	Progress on Windows.Forms has been good, but we need more work
	on this area.  Currently redrawing of controls is not
	funcional.

** Languages work

	Mono has work-in-progress implementations of JScript and the
	VB.NET languages

	<ul>
		<li>Write positive tests for those languages.
	
		<li>Write negative tests for those languages.

		<li>Mono-devel-list is the mailing list to discuss
		improvements and fixes to those compilers.
	</ul>

** Debugger

	<ul>
		<li>The Mono debugger needs some better widgets to
		provide a useful environment, many of those have been
		authored for Anjuta/gIDE, we should wrap those for the
		debugger

		<li>Design a small tool-command-language like Tcl to
		build the debugger on top of it.

		<li>Design work: a new UI design must be done
		for the debugger and later implemented.
	</ul>

** Research topics

	<ul>
		<li>Design and implement a command processor like the
		Unix shell, but which uses .NET objects as commands.
		This shell would be a CLS consumer ideally, and only
		later a CLS producer.  This should make it simple for
		people to explore the .NET API interactively. 
	</ul>

** IDE development

	Mono lacks an IDE, and we depend on third-parties to work on
	these.  

	<ul>
		Sharp 
	</ul>
