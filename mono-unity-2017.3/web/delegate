* Your Delegate Has Been Garbage Collected.

	The program that you are running passed a delegate into the
	unmanaged world but failed to keep a reference to this
	delegate in the managed world, so the delegate was garbage
	collected.

	This means that the the delegate is no longer valid, but the
	unmanaged library or unmanaged code tried to call it.

	To fix this problem make sure that you keep a handle to the
	delegate that you are passing into the unmanaged world.

	This happens since Mono has no visibility into the unmanaged
	world and it does not know that the unmanaged world has kept a
	reference to your delegate.  As far as the Mono runtime is
	concerned the delegate must be garbage collected.
