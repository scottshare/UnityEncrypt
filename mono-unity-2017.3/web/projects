* Open Projects

	The .NET framework is a good first in terms of a new
	development foundation, but it falls short of providing
	higher-level components or building blocks for people to
	reuse.  

	A few ideas of projects and classes that would be useful to
	develop applications follows:

** EOG component

* Gtk# related projects

	Gnome Canvas Bindings.  

	Bezier Canvas Item Binding.

* Graphical bindings

	Binding for the Libart library
