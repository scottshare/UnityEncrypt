* purpose

	This tool is to generate globalization information from Unicode CLDR, with some changes
	to fill the gap between .NET(Windows)-ism and the global standard.

* input resources

	There is only an external resource: unicode CLDR. I used version 1.7, the latest one as of
	May, 2009:
	http://unicode.org/Public/cldr/1.7.0/core.zip

	There is a couple of extra mono resources included in this directory:
	- lcids.xml for LCIDs.
	- textinfos.xml for TextInfo.
	- supplementalData.xml and supp/*.xml for .NET(Windows)-ism fixup.

* generated file

	culture-info-table.h contains the following sections:

	- datetime_format_entries
	  See DateTimeFormatEntry.AppendTableRow() in DateTimeFormatEntry.cs.
	- number_format_entries
	  See NumberFormatEntry.AppendTableRow() in NumberFormatEntry.cs.
	- culture_entries
	  See CultureInfoEntry.AppendTableRow() in CultureInfoEntry.cs.
	- culture_name_entries
	  See Driver.Run() in Driver.cs.
	- region_entries
	  See RegionInfoEntry.AppendTableRow() in RegionInfoEntry.cs.
	- region_name_entries
	  See Driver.Run() in Driver.cs.
	- locale_strings
	  See Driver.Run() in Driver.cs.

	In each entry, strings are extracted to locale_strings table, and in each structure they are
	represented as an index to the string.
