	* Options.cs: GetLineEnd() shouldn't skip the start character, as it
	  may contain '\n' (thus preventing the following text from being
	  properly indented).

	* Options.cs: Viktor Lundgren reported that Option.Description text of 
	  `"aaa." . "a" x 64` (that is, "aaa." followed by 64 "a"s) would cause 
	  GetLines() to go into an infinite loop and (eventually) die from an 
	  OutOfMemoryException.  Oops.  Fix this, simplify the logic, and turn 
	  GetLines() into an IEnumerable<string>.

	* Options.cs: Options.cs: Use the underlying target type in the error 
	  message, because "Could not convert string `' to type Nullable`1..." 
	  is not nearly as helpful as "Could not convert string `' to type 
	  Int32...".

	* Option.cs: Add support for nullable types to Options.Parse<T>().
	  Namespace "harmonization" with NDesk.Options so that the same source 
	  file can be used in each project.

	* ChangeLog: Started.
	* Options.cs: Added; Command line option parser.  A (renamed) copy of
	  NDesk.Options 0.2.1 (see git repo for prior history).
