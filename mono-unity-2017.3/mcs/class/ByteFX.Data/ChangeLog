2005-08-25  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Makefile : /codepage:28591 (otherwise the build is broken on utf8
	  environment).

2004-11-26  Raja R Harinath  <rharinath@novell.com>

	* Makefile (OTHER_RES): New.  List of resources.
	(EXTRA_DISTFILES): Distribute them.

2004-05-18  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* AssemblyInfo.cs: Gonzalo reminded me that I need to update the
	version number as well. We're at 0.7.6 now.

	* Common/StreamCreator.cs (CreateUnixSocketStream): Instead of
	hostList [0], which is a char, use hostList directly. This fixes
	the build.

2004-05-18  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* Makefile: Add reference to Mono.Posix.dll.
	
	* ByteFX.Data.dll.sources: Update to latest listing of source
	files.

	* AssemblyInfo.cs: Revert back to the previous version, because we
	don't have bytefx.snk.

	* mysqlclient/transcaction.cs: Removed, replaced by the new
	transaction.cs.

2003-03-15  Daniel Morgan <danmorg@sc.rr.com>

	* mysqlclient/datareader.cs: in GetSchemaTable(),
	"BaseColumnName" should be set to the ColumnName,
	not null

2003-03-14  Daniel Morgan <danmorg@sc.rr.com>

	Imported the ByteFX.Data MySQL 0.6.5 data provider.  See
	ChangeLog at the root of mcs for this date.
