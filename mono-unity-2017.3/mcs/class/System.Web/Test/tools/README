	* HtmlWriter.cs: it provides a custom HtmlTextWriter implementation with
	logging capabilities to help figuring out which method in HtmlTextWriter
	you should invoke and where to do it.

	How to use it.
	---------------
		* Run 'make'. It will generate HtmlWriter.dll.
		* Copy HtmlWriter.dll to the 'bin' directory.
		* Copy web.config to the directory in which you run xsp
		(the parent of 'bin').
		* There are 2 environment variables used:
			-HTMLWRITER_FULLTRACE=yes: displays the stack trace for
			every method called.
			-HTMLWRITER_FILE=[yourfilename]: output goes to a file
			instead of stdout.

	The default output is a sequence number, the function called and its
	arguments.
