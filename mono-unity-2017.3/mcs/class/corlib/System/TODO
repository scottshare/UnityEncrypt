System.Object:
	Need a mechanism for getting an object underlying type.

System.ValueType:
	Need to lock memory and "scan" the actual contents to compute
	hash code and do comparissions.  Should be simple to do with
	C#, the problem is figuring out the size of the object.

System.String:
	Need to implement the Format() and CompareOrdinal() methods 
	as we all implement all of the methods that take into account 
	CultureInfo or Encoding stuff.

System.Array:
	It's not possible to test to see if the whole thing works, as
	GetValue() and SetValue() make calls into the runtime. However,
	I've tried my implementations of things like BinarySearch() and
	Sort() on the MS-provided System.Array and they seem to work fine.
	According to the spec, System.Array implements the IList interface.
	The spec doesn't have the methods for those interfaces, however,
	the class doesn't (yet) implement that interface and those methods
	are not (yet) written.
